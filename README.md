- Open Heroku dashboard : https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/domain-salesforce
- Open App : https://domain-salesforce.herokuapp.com/lustral (lustral or any directory in GitHub repertory)


How to add a new domain image page :
- (1) Duplicate lustral repertory in the same root directory : lets call it "example123"
- (2) Change your domain.png to yours (do not change the file name) 
- (3) You should have in a repertory named "example123" : an index.html and a domain.png (step 2)
- (4 - Optional) You can check that the build is OK in the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/domain-salesforce/activity), this is automatic and should not be mandatory. However, if you change the files too fast, you may need to Deploy the app manually ([Heroku Dashboard > Deploy tab](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/domain-salesforce/deploy/github) > Deploy Branch (button))
